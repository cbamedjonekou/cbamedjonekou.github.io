# CBA's Portfolio:

This portfolio covers the following topics: Machine Learning Models (both classical and deep learning models), Mathematical Modeling using Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems, Data Structures and Algorithms, IoT/Embedded Systems, Drones, Red/Blue Teaming, and anything else that catches my eye. Formally, I'm an Applied Mathematics student but through my continuous exposure with different technologies/methods (while using Math as a base/springboard) I hope to co-op the title '***Hacker***'.


**Follow me throughout my journey.**

# Machine Learning in Astronomy Coursework:

## RRLyrae Dataset 

***Decision Trees/Cross Validation***

* For this particular dataset we investigated the pitfalls of unbalanced data. RR Lyrae are variable stars in the Lyra constellation. It plays a significant role in astronomy and has been studied extensively by Astronomers. The reason for this is because they are the brightest star in their class. This particular characteristic of RR Lyrae is important as it acts as a ***standard candle*** that can be used to meaure astronimical distances ([more on RR Lyrae here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RR_Lyrae_variable)). For this particular problem, we are presented with a dataset that contains 93141 instances (stars) with each instance containing 4 features which are the colors of the star. These colors which give an indication of whether a star emits more blue, green, yellow, or red light. We are also provided with the target vector implying that this is a supervised task. We use Decisions Trees in an attempt to classify the 93141 instances (stars) either as an RR Lyrae variable star or not. We also have an instance of unbalanced data here and use methods in an attempt to resolve this issue.

During the Fall 2018 semester, I took three interrelated courses dealing w/ Telecommunications, Digital Electronics, and Communication Electronics. When writing notes for the courses, I found myself having to do tedious calculations. Especially since I was typing my notes I decided that I should create a module that allowed me to access the functions without having to copy them from notebook to notebook. This module is a result of that problem.

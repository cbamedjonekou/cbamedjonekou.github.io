# Deaththeberry's Portfolio:

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which covers my efforts in learning Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Hacking Proof of Concepts, relevant School Projects, and relevant stand-alone projects. There are separate categories for separate projects.

# Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence/Proof of Concepts/Analysis:

## Stand-alone projects:

### EET_TCET_kit: Electronics/Telecommunications Toolkit:

[Github]()

During the Fall 2018 semester, I took three interrelated courses dealing w/ Telecommunications, Digital Electronics, and Communication Electronics. When writing notes for the courses [click here](https://github.com/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/tree/master/Labs), I found myself having to do tedious calculations. Especially since I was typing my notes I decided that I should create a module that allowed me to access the functions without having to copy them from notebook to notebook. This module is a result of that problem.

## Kaggle DataSets/Competitions:

## Kaggle kernels:

## Classification problems:

### Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster:

[Github](https://github.com/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/Titanic_A%20Machine%20Learning%20from%20Disaster_Project.ipynb) [nbviewer (Click this!)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/Titanic_A%20Machine%20Learning%20from%20Disaster_Project.ipynb?flush_cache=true)

(**FUTURE PROJECT, SOON TO COME**) Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so did I. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
Titanic dataset provides interesting opportunities for feature engineering.

## Regression problems:

### House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques:

[Github](https://github.com/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/House%20Prices_%20Advanced%20Regression%20Techniques_Project.ipynb) [nbviewer (Click this!)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/House%20Prices_%20Advanced%20Regression%20Techniques_Project.ipynb?flush_cache=true)

(**FUTURE PROJECT, SOON TO COME**) House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a regression problem: based on information about houses we predict their prices. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
The dataset has a lot of features and many missing values. This gives interesting possibilities for feature transformation and data visualization.

## Natural language processing:

### Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn:

[Github](https://github.com/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/Bag%20of%20Words%20Meets%20Bags%20of%20Popcorn_Project.ipynb) [nbviewer (Click this!)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/Bag%20of%20Words%20Meets%20Bags%20of%20Popcorn_Project.ipynb?flush_cache=true)

(**FUTURE PROJECT, SOON TO COME**) Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn is a sentimental analysis problem. Based on texts of reviews we predict whether they are positive or negative. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial).
The data provided consists of raw reviews and class (1 or 2), so the main part is cleaning the texts.

## Clustering:

### Clustering with KMeans:

[Github](https://github.com/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/Clustering%20with%20KMeans%20Project.ipynb) [nbviewer (Click this!)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/Clustering%20with%20KMeans%20Project.ipynb?flush_cache=true)

(**FUTURE PROJECT, SOON TO COME**) Clustering is an approach to unsupervised machine learning. Clustering with KMeans is one of algorithms of clustering. in this notebook I'll demonstrate how it works. Data used is about various types of seeds and their parameters. It is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds).

## Neural networks:

### Feedforward neural network with regularization:

(**FUTURE PROJECT, SOON TO COME**) This is a simple example of feedforward neural network with regularization. It is based on Andrew Ng's lectures on Coursera. I used data from Kaggle's challenge "Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!", it is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo).

### Labs:

[Github](https://github.com/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/tree/master/Labs)

This section contains labs and notes, created during the Fall Semester of 2018, that I believe showcases either python syntax skills or the use of python data analysis libraries such as seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, and numpy. If projects are deserve their own section, they'll be shown seperately.

# ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which covers my efforts in learning Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Hacking Techniques. There are separate categories for separate projects.

## Stand-alone projects.

## Kaggle DataSets/Competitions.

### Avito demand prediction

[Avito demand prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-demand-prediction) was a competition on Kaggle where we tried to predict something like demand based on ads content. This competition was very interesting because it had tabular data, texts and images. On the other hand this was the reason the competition was quite difficult. My team reached 131th place and got bronze medal! Here is a [link](https://github.com/Erlemar/Avito_demand_prediction_2018) to my solution.

## Kaggle kernels.

## Classification problems.

## Regression problems.

## Natural language processing.

## Clustering

## Neural networks

### Feedforward neural network with regularization

[Github](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/NN_GGG.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/NN_GGG.ipynb)

This is a simple example of feedforward neural network with regularization. It is based on Andrew Ng's lectures on Coursera. I used data from Kaggle's challenge "Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!", it is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo).

## Data exploration and analysis

### SF Salaries Data

[Github](https://github.com/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/SF%20Salaries%20Exercise.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/SF%20Salaries%20Exercise.ipynb)

This is my First Data Analysis Project. Here I used the [SF Salaries Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/sf-salaries/home) to explore the following:

- Average Base Pay
- Largest Overtime Pay
- Who the Highest and Lowest Paid Person is...
- Unique Job Titles
- What the Most Common Jobs are
- The amount of Job Titles represented by only one person
- The amount of high position persons 

This was based on Pierian Data's Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp lectures on Udemy.

## Recommendation systems.

### Collaborative filtering

[Github](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Collaborative_filtering.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Collaborative_filtering.ipynb)

Recommenders are systems, which predict ratings of users for items. There are several approaches to build such systems and one of them is Collaborative Filtering. 
This notebook shows sev—Éral examples of collaborative filtering algorithms.

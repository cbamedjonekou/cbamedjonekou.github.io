This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which covers my efforts in learning Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Hacking Techniques. There are separate categories for separate projects.

# Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence:

## Stand-alone projects.

## Kaggle DataSets/Competitions.

## Kaggle kernels.

## Classification problems.

### Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

[Github](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Titanic.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Titanic.ipynb)

Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so did I. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
Titanic dataset provides interesting opportunities for feature engineering.

## Regression problems

### House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

[Github](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/House_Prices.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/House_Prices.ipynb)

House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a regression problem: based on information about houses we predict their prices. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
The dataset has a lot of features and many missing values. This gives interesting possibilities for feature transformation and data visualization.

## Natural language processing

### Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn

[Github](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Bag_of_Words.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Bag_of_Words.ipynb)

Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn is a sentimental analysis problem. Based on texts of reviews we predict whether they are positive or negative. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial).
The data provided consists of raw reviews and class (1 or 2), so the main part is cleaning the texts.

## Clustering

### Clustering with KMeans

[Github](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Clustering_with_K-Means.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Clustering_with_K-Means.ipynb)

Clustering is an approach to unsupervised machine learning. Clustering with KMeans is one of algorithms of clustering. in this notebook I'll demonstrate how it works. Data used is about various types of seeds and their parameters. It is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds).

## Neural networks

### Feedforward neural network with regularization

[Github](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/NN_GGG.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/NN_GGG.ipynb)

This is a simple example of feedforward neural network with regularization. It is based on Andrew Ng's lectures on Coursera. I used data from Kaggle's challenge "Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!", it is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo).

## Data Exploration, Visualization, and Analysis

### SF Salaries Data

[Github](https://github.com/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/SF%20Salaries%20Exercise.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/SF%20Salaries%20Exercise.ipynb)

This is my First Data Analysis Project. Here I used the [SF Salaries Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/sf-salaries/home) to explore the following:

- Average Base Pay
- Largest Overtime Pay
- Who the Highest and Lowest Paid Person is...
- Unique Job Titles
- What the Most Common Jobs are
- The amount of Job Titles represented by only one person
- The amount of high position persons 

This was based on Pierian Data's Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp lectures on Udemy.

### Ecommerce Purchases Data

[Github](https://github.com/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/Ecommerce%20Purchases.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/Ecommerce%20Purchases.ipynb)

This is the second of my Data Analysis Projects. Here I used the [Ecommerce Purchases Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/master/Notebooks/Ecommerce%20Purchases) to explore the following:

- Average Purchase Price
- The Highest and Lowest Purchase Price
- Language of Choice
- Job Titles
- Purchase Times (AM or PM)
- Emails associated w/ Credit Card Numbers, and Email Providers
- Card Numbers, expiration dates

This was based on Pierian Data's Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp lectures on Udemy.

### NumPy Review

[Github](https://github.com/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/Numpy%20Exercise%20.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/Numpy%20Exercise%20.ipynb)

This is a review from when I was learning to implement numpy methods. Again, this was based on Pierian Data's Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp lectures on Udemy.

### MatPlotLib Review

[Github](https://github.com/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/Numpy%20Exercise%20.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/Numpy%20Exercise%20.ipynb)

This is a review from when I was learning to implement matplotlib methods. Again, this was based on Pierian Data's Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp lectures on Udemy.

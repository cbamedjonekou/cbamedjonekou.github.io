# ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which covers my efforts in learning Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Hacking Techniques. There are separate categories for separate projects.

## Stand-alone projects.

## Kaggle DataSets/Competitions.

### Avito demand prediction

[Avito demand prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-demand-prediction) was a competition on Kaggle where we tried to predict something like demand based on ads content. This competition was very interesting because it had tabular data, texts and images. On the other hand this was the reason the competition was quite difficult. My team reached 131th place and got bronze medal! Here is a [link](https://github.com/Erlemar/Avito_demand_prediction_2018) to my solution.

## Kaggle kernels.

## Classification problems.

## Regression problems.

## Natural language processing.

## Clustering

## Neural networks

### Feedforward neural network with regularization

[Github](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/NN_GGG.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/NN_GGG.ipynb)

This is a simple example of feedforward neural network with regularization. It is based on Andrew Ng's lectures on Coursera. I used data from Kaggle's challenge "Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!", it is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo).

## Data exploration and analysis

### Telematic data

[Github](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Devices_analysis.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Devices_analysis.ipynb)

I have a dataset with telematic information about 10 cars driving during one day. I visualise data, search for insights and analyse the behavior of each driver. I can't share the data, but here is the notebook. I want to notice that folium map can't be rendered by native github, but nbviewer.jupyter can do it.

## Recommendation systems.

### Collaborative filtering

[Github](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Collaborative_filtering.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Collaborative_filtering.ipynb)

Recommenders are systems, which predict ratings of users for items. There are several approaches to build such systems and one of them is Collaborative Filtering. 
This notebook shows sev—Éral examples of collaborative filtering algorithms.

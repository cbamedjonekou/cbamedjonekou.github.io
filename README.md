# CBA's Portfolio:

The following portfolio contains work related to Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Math Related Coursework (such as Optimization, Discrete/Continuous Dynamical Systems, Fourier Series/Transforms). The format used for these notebooks is of the extension .ipynb (Jupyter Notebooks) and all code segments contained in these notebooks are written in Python. This portfolio can be viewed as my journey learning about the previously mentioned topics. 

# Python Modules:

### EETCET_modkit: Electronics/Telecommunications Toolkit Module:

During the Fall 2018 semester, I took three interrelated courses dealing w/ Telecommunications, Digital Electronics, and Communication Electronics. When writing notes for the courses [click here](https://github.com/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/tree/master/Labs), I found myself having to do tedious calculations. Especially since I was typing my notes I decided that I should create a module that allowed me to access the functions without having to copy them from notebook to notebook. This module is a result of that problem.

## Mathematical Modeling of Continuous and Discrete Dynamical Systems

### The Whale Problem

**Part 1**

* **The Whale Problem** was a problem that was recurrent in our class. We constantly added to it in our exploration of modeling continuous and discrete dynamical systems. We viewed the Whale Problem as a continuous dynamical system where the rates of change were instantaneous. The first case was a dynamical model featuring one growth equation. This is shown in the links below:

* We calculate the equilibrium points in which we utilize the Five Step Method. The theory for Dynamical Models, and the methodology of the Five Step Method are all discussed in the links above. But finding the equilibrium points allow us to form the beginnings of a qualitive answer to the dynamical model. 

**Part 2**

* A variant of the previous Whale Problem which introduces the Dynamical System, a system of 'n' growth functions (here n = 2). We examine the Blue Whale in competition with the Fin Whale. As a result, we are introduced to the competition term. We also conduct sensitivity analysis of the 'alpha' term. As with the previous whale problem, we evaluate the model using the Five-Step Method to produce a qualitive answer to our model. The links below show us this in detail.

* We also do this with the Blue Whale in Competition with Krill. This is shown below, as well.

**Part 3**

* A variant of the previous Whale Problem. On top of examining the Blue Whale in competition with the Fin Whale, we also consider a situation where there is harvesting. As a result, we are introduce another term. As with the previous whale problem, we evaluate the model using the Five-Step Method to produce a qualitive answer to our model. The links below show us this in detail. 

	* [Github.com/Whale-Problem-3](https://github.com/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Labs/MAT%204880-D692%20(Math%20Modeling%20II)/MAT%204880-D692%20(Math%20Modeling%20II)%20Whale%20Problem%203.ipynb)

### The Astronaut Problem

* The Astronaut Problem is an example of a Discete Dynamical System. We examine the differences between the continous and Discrete Dynamica System. **"Vector Plots are no longer enough to determine stability!!!"** We learned that there is a time delay that affects the qualitative answers we get w/ continuous dynamical systems.

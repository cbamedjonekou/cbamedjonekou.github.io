# CBA's Portfolio:

This portfolio covers the following topics: Machine Learning Models (both classical and deep learning models), Mathematical Modeling using Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems, Data Structures and Algorithms, IoT/Embedded Systems, Drones, pentesting, and anything else that catches my eye. Formally, I'm an Applied Mathematics student but through my continuous exposure with different technologies (while using Math as a base/springboard) I hope to co-op the title '***Hacker***'.
Follow me throughout my journey.

***Definition: Hacker | Hacker Culture - subculture of individuals who enjoy the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations of systems to achieve novel and clever outcomes***

During the Fall 2018 semester, I took three interrelated courses dealing w/ Telecommunications, Digital Electronics, and Communication Electronics. When writing notes for the courses, I found myself having to do tedious calculations. Especially since I was typing my notes I decided that I should create a module that allowed me to access the functions without having to copy them from notebook to notebook. This module is a result of that problem.

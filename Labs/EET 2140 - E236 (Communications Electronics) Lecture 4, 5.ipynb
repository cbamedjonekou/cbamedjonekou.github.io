    "**Modulation was the topic of discussion, specifically amplitude modulation.**\n",

    "**Previous Lecture Notes try to show the importance of modulation in communications systems. Modulation involves combining an information signal with a carrier**\n",

    "* Information signal: An information signal is often a signal whose instantaneous peak voltage is constantly changing and whose range of occupied frequencies is relatively low.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Carrier signal: A carrier signal is a relatively high-frequency sine wave of constant amplitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the case of amplitude modulation (AM), the carrier is also of constant frequency. Under certain conditions combining any two (or more) signals of different frequencies will cause them to interact in a way that creates additional frequencies, each bearing a mathematical relationship to those being combined. The process just hightlighted is called *Mixing*. We'll cover a special case in these lecture notes. Since we're dealing with Waves, knowing the following is important:**\n",

    "* Phase -- $\\theta$\n",
    "\n",
    "*** Recall also that the information signal is generally termed the \"intelligence\". Other terms for intelligence are modulating signal, audio signal, or modulating wave. AM, which conveys information through changes in the instantaneous peak voltage (amplitude) of the modulated carrier, is the oldest and most straightforward of the approaches and is the focus of this section.***\n",

If it were transmitted, the receiving antenna would detect just the carrier signal because the low-frequency intelligence component cannot be propagated efficiently as a radio wave.\n",

    "*  A nonlinear device or circuit is one where changes in current are not directly proportional to changes in applied voltage.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "* As a result, interference (that's desirable) takes place between the high-frequency carrier and the low-frequency intelligence.

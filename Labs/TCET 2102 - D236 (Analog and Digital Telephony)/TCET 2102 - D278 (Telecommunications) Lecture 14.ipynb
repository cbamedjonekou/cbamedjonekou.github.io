    "## Fiber Optics\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fibers optics is defined as the branch of optics that deals with the transmission of light through ultrapure fibers of glass, plastic, or other forms of transparent media.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They are considerable better than copper wire specifically in the following areas:\n",
    "    * A lot More Bandwidth\n",
    "    * Less dB Loss\n",
    "    * Immune to Noise\n",
    "    * They weight less than their copper counterpart\n",
    "    * They're impossible to wire tap w/o detection\n",
    "    * Due to refining process and size, fiber is extremely durable. You can cut someone w/ it.\n",
    "    * Overall cost of fiber systems are cheaper since less resources are used (e.g.: less repeaters)\n",
    "    * Have a longer lifespan, less affected by the elements, more reliability as a result.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are disadvantages to Fiber as well which are specifically in the following areas:\n",
    "    * There are interfacing costs that are usually overlook specifically dealing w/ electronic to optic conversion of provider facilities.\n",
    "    * Strength of the cable w/ reinforcment is weak but w/ kevlar reinforcement can increase the tensile strength (greater than coaxial)\n",
    "    * Fiber can't provide power to remote devices (no electricity...) on its own, so now they're bundled w/ conductive components.\n",
    " \n"

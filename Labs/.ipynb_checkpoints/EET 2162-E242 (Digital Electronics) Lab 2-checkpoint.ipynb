    "* NAND gates are a combination of AND gates coupled with NOT gates (inverters). Thus the NAND gate produces truth values opposite that of an AND gate. Remember, for AND gates you only get a true value (or 1, digitally) when both inputs were turned \"ON\", and false for everything else. The opposite is true for NAND gates as aforementioned. For NAND gates you get a true value (or 1, digitally) when the following occurs: True, False; False, True; False, False (two inputs). When both inputs were turned \"ON\" (True, True) you get a false value for the output.\n",

Remember, for OR gates you only get a true value (or 1, digitally) when either of the imputs or both were turned on, and false for everything else. The opposite is true for NOR gates as aforementioned. For NOR gates, you get a \"False\" value (or 0, digitally) when either of the imputs or both are turned \"ON\".

In comparison to the base 10 counting system in which we are familiar, also known as the \"Decimal\" counting system, binary is of base 2. This means that instead of counting up to 9 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) like we are used to before shifting to the 10's place, we count up to 1 (0, 1) before shifting over to the next place. Also in binary the 10s place will instead be referred to as the 2's place since it is base 2. (E.g.:...$2^3$, $2^2$, $2^1$, $2^0$, $2^{-1}$, $2^{-2}$...)\n",

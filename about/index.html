        <h1>About CB.Amedjonekou</h1>
	<p>This portfolio covers the following topics: Machine Learning Models (both classical and deep learning models), Mathematical Modeling using Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems, Data Structures and Algorithms, IoT/Embedded Systems, Drones, Red/Blue Teaming, and anything else that catches my eye. Formally, I'm an Applied Mathematics student but through my continuous exposure with different technologies/methods (while using Math as a base/springboard) I hope to co-op the title '***Hacker***'. Follow me throughout my journey.</p>

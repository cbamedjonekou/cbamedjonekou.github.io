# CBA's Portfolio:

The following portfolio contains work related to Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Artificial Intellingence, Malware Analysis (as it relates Machine Learning), and Math Related Coursework (such as Mathematical Modeling, Numerical Analysis). The format used for these notebooks is of the extension .ipynb (Jupyter Notebooks) and all code segments contained in these notebooks are written in Python. This portfolio can be viewed as my journey learning about the previously mentioned topics. 

# Python Modules:

### EETCET_modkit: Electronics/Telecommunications Toolkit Module:

During the Fall 2018 semester, I took three interrelated courses dealing w/ Telecommunications, Digital Electronics, and Communication Electronics. When writing notes for the courses [click here](https://github.com/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/tree/master/Labs), I found myself having to do tedious calculations. Especially since I was typing my notes I decided that I should create a module that allowed me to access the functions without having to copy them from notebook to notebook. This module is a result of that problem.

# Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence:

## Kaggle DataSets/Competitions:

## Kaggle kernels:

## Classification problems:

## Regression problems:

## Natural language processing:

## Clustering:

## Neural networks:

## Data Exploration, Visualization, and Analysis:

### Problem Sets:

[Github](https://github.com/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/tree/master/Projects/Python%20Packages%20Practice) 

This section contains all the example problem sets I worked on while learning the basics of the Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly libraries/modules (for Data Exploration, Visualization, and Analysis). I used the MOOC "Pierian Data's Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp " provided on Udemy.

# Math Related Coursework

## Mathematical Modeling Optimization

## Mathematical Modeling of Continuous and Discrete Dynamical Systems

## Numerical Analysis

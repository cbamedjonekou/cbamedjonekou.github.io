### 911 Calls Data:

[Github](https://github.com/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/911%20Calls%20Data%20Project%20.ipynb) [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/911%20Calls%20Data%20Project%20.ipynb)


This is my Second Project. Here I used the [Emergency - 911 Calls](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert) to explore the following:

*  loading the Dataset, and finding out the raw information about the dataset such as number of columns, rows, and how large the dataset is in general
*  Finding surface level information about the dataset such as "Top 5 zipcodes for 911 calls", "Top 5 townships (twp) for 911 calls", unique title codes
*  Creating new features, and applying visualizations on top of these features. 

In this particular **"project"**, again, I focused on using/gaining some familiarity working with dataset and using the following modules: **Pandas, Seaborn, NumPy, Matplotlib**. I feel as though I've become more comfortable using these module at the completion of this project, especially with the use of the documentation, stackoverflow, general google searches, etc. Any new updates to this project will feature a summary along with the date in which the update was completed. Again, this was based on Pierian Data's Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp lectures on Udemy.

### NumPy Review:

This is a review from when I was learning to implement numpy methods. Again, this was based on Pierian Data's Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp lectures on Udemy.

### SF Salaries Data:

[Github](https://github.com/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/SF%20Salaries%20Exercise.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/SF%20Salaries%20Exercise.ipynb?flush_cache=true)

This is my First Mini Project. Here I used the [SF Salaries Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/sf-salaries/home) to explore the following:

- Average Base Pay
- Largest Overtime Pay
- Who the Highest and Lowest Paid Person is...
- Unique Job Titles
- What the Most Common Jobs are
- The amount of Job Titles represented by only one person
- The amount of high position persons 

The **SF Salaries Data Set** appears to be a popular Data Set on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/sf-salaries/home) and something I plan to revisit in the future, maybe as a kernel. However, in this particular **"mini project"** I focused on using/gaining some familiarity with the **Pandas** module. I feel as though I've become comfortable w/ the module via the completion of this project, especially with the use of the documentation, stackoverflow, general google searches, etc. Any new updates to this project will feature a summary along with the date in which the update was completed. Again, this was based on Pierian Data's Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp lectures on Udemy.

### Ecommerce Purchases Data:

This is my Second Mini Project. Here I used the [Ecommerce Purchases Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deaththeberry/ML-AI-HKG_Portfolio/master/Notebooks/Ecommerce%20Purchases) to explore the following:

- Average Purchase Price
- The Highest and Lowest Purchase Price
- Language of Choice
- Job Titles
- Purchase Times (AM or PM)
- Emails associated w/ Credit Card Numbers, and Email Providers
- Card Numbers, expiration dates

In this particular **"mini project"**, again, I focused on using/gaining some familiarity with the **Pandas** module. I feel as though I've become comfortable w/ the module via the completion of this project, especially with the use of the documentation, stackoverflow, general google searches, etc. Any new updates to this project will feature a summary along with the date in which the update was completed.
